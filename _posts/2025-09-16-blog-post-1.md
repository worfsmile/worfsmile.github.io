This work conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D shape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives.

Problem to solve

======

1. Challenges in extracting features from multiple views of a 3D shape
   1. the more views, the more pixels, the more computationally expensive
2. Voxel convolution versus pixel convolution
   1. 2D representations are more efficient for 3D shape recognition
   2. leveraging advanced image representation techniques
   3. mesh image datasets are available to pre-train CNNs

Main idea
