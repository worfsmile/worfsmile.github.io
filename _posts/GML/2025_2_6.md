# Basics of ML in high dimension

## graphs

Homogeneous graphs are systems of relations and interactions.

structural properties of a graph and its adjacency matrix

graph function $f(X,A)$

node function $F(X,A)$

Next, we examine the permutation-equivariant property: $F(PX,PAP^T)=PF(X,A)$. This equation means that $F$ is invariant to the permutation of $X$.

### A general blueprint for constructing graph function

local function and message passing

## grids

Grids are ring graphs, and they encounter problems that the neighbor states are all the same.

shift-equivariant

convolution emerges from translation symmetry

## fourier transform from symmetry

spatial domain and frequency domain

circulant matrix and element-wise product

## groups

convolution is a matching shifted filter. it is also a matching transformed filter
$$
(x*\phi)(\underset{shift\ vector}{u})=<x,\underset{shift\ operator}{T_u}\phi>=\int^{+\infty}_{-\infty}x(v)\phi(u-v)dv
$$

$$
(x*\phi)(\underset{group\ element}{g})=<x,\underset{group\ representation}{\rho(g)}\phi>=\int_{\Omega}x(v)\phi(g^{-1}v)dv
$$

homogenous spaces

## geodesics & gauges

- euclidean and non euclidean

manifold is a locally euclidean space, meaning that on a small scale, it resembles Euclidean space

riemannian metric includes local length and direction

Isometry is metric-preserving deformation. An isometry is a transformation (or deformation) of a manifold that preserves the distances and angles.

Summarize above we can get that we can apply methods that work in Euclidean space to a manifold locally, since a manifold resembles Euclidean space on a small scale. However, it is clear that we also need specialized methods to account for the global structure of the manifold in our operations.
$$
(x*\phi)(u)=\int_{\R^2}\phi(v)x(exp_u\omega_uv)dv
$$
Gauge defined up to gauge transformation
