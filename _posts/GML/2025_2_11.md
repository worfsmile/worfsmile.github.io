design GNN



## General attributed graphs

node features

edge features

graph features

## graphs networks

- update edge features
  $$
  h_{uv}=\Phi(x_u,x_v,x_{uv},x_G)
  $$
  
- update node features
  $$
  h_u=\phi(x_u,\oplus_{\mathcal{N}_u}h_{uv},x_G)
  $$



- update graph features





### latent graph inference

ground truth and latent graph

in practice, the given graph may often be suboptimal for the task.

- no graph?
  - deep sets
  - fully connected



### a note on transformers

fully connected graph

attention makes the strength level two nodes connected



### infer adjacency matrix A

concerning that the empty graph ignores potential wealth of information and full graph can be hard to scale, we want to infer the adjacency matrix A then use it as edges for GNN!

choosing edges is discrete decision!

### some methods

- infer edges to use variational
  - prior $p(a_{uv})$
  - run GNs on fully connected graph to obtain edge features
  - decode posterior over the edges, $q(a_{uv}|X)=\sigma(\Phi(h_{uv}))$
  - sample edges from this posterior, i.e. $a_{uv}\sim q(a_{uv}|X)$
  - use this edge for a second GN to compute outputs
- k-NN graphs
  - solve the full-connect problem
  - connect it only to its k nearest neighbours in $h$

- top-k
  - use e.g. $h^{\top}h$ to count similarity
- reinforcement learning
- supervised learning



### GNNs power

GNNs are no more powerful than 1-WL



### analyse failure cases of 1-WL

- rings
  - compute graph
  - see itself
  - RP-GNN
  - P-GNN
